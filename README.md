## Development

Head over to the official [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) in
order to :

- set up Android Studio,
- set up an sdk,
- set up a virtual device.



Then, start your android emulator, go into the "MTonAir" folder and run :

> npx react-native start

(there's a [start.cmd](MTonAir/start.cmd) file for Windows users...).

And finally, run :

(in the MTonAir folder)

> npm install

> npx react-native run-android

in another command window.

Then, the app should start in your virtual device. Press the R key twice or select `Reload` from the Developer Menu (`CTRL + M`) to see the changes.
Read the [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), "environment setup" section for any more help.
